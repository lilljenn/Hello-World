          <div class="column">
            The following instructions may apply:
            <ul id="directions">
              <li>Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure a place in line.</li>
              <li>Each person receives no more than 2 tickets at the Main Room beginning at 8 am on Saturday.</li>
              <li>The number on the ticket reserves your place in line, allowing you to get coffee or visit our other rooms, but please be sure to arrive before the Main Room opens. If you miss the time when your number is allowed, you forfeit your place in line. If you don't arrive in time to get a ticket, please join the latter part of the line.</li>
              <li>Because of our severe space limitations and issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at one time.</li>
              <li>On Saturdays, customers will be admitted in the order of their numbered tickets from 8 am to 11 am.</li>
              <li>There is a limit of 12 books at a time.</li>
              <li>After items are purchased, customers should exit through the east door.</li>
              <li>Customers may join the end of any remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order.</li>
              <li>The limit of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.</li>
              <li>You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.</li>
            </ul>
